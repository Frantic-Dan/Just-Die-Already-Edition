                       <Description>An overhaul vanilla mod for veteran players who find pure vanilla too easy and are seeking a challenge with the vanilla feel. This overhaul mod adds survival that is lacking in the game.

			**This version is even tougher than the Survivalist Version**

			Recommended settings:
			Warrior, Run during the day, No loot respawn, 24 blood moon count, Airdrops weekly.

			- More wild zombie spawns.
			- Slower progression to extend the live of a world to 100+ days.
			- Farming is nerfed so the struggle for food extends to mid game.
			- Less ammo, food and quantity in loot, less resources when mining and harvesting ores/blocks.
			- Economy rebalanced so you won't be swimming in dukes and make thoughtful decisions when buying.
			- A Single Player reworking of the Charismatic Nature perk. (Survival Instinct)
			- Dying has a harsher consequence, retaining debuffs and hunger, etc.
			- And much more!
			***Added the Spencer Mansion (Resident Evil) a Tier 6 quest***
			***You MUST use Nitrogen and download the supporting file (link below) for it to spawn in your world***
			***Or place manually in your existing world to avoid restarting***
